Mission 2 Project for Computation Creativity Fall 2018.  

This system takes an input folder with one or more images and generates an output image based on transition matrices
for each images.  The output images are quite stripey and at lower dimensions/resolution resemble camo patterns that 
are visibly inspired from the image(s) in the input folder.  

The system can be run by simply running the markov_images.py file. 

Output is saved as curr_test.png in the same directory that the markov_images.py file is run in.
